                Team Teaching
              </h3>
              <p className="">
                The team-teaching approach to education is an offshoot of the
                Bank Street philosophy. In the elementary grades (Iâ€“V), we have
                a grade teaching system. Each classroom has two instructors to
                teach core subjects resulting in a smaller student-teacher
                ratio. From grade six onwards, students move about the building
                to subject-specific classrooms and laboratories. Core subject
                teachers across the grades make a special effort to collaborate
                with teachers of other subjects and departments, such as
                physical education, art, music, drama and Mandarin, for a more
                integrated and holistic learning experience.
                <br />
                Teachers work with students five days a week. They work a sixth
                day each week developing lesson plans and attending in-school
                professional development workshops. They have weekly conferences
                with their supervisors and faculty meetings every two weeks.
                Teachers are regularly observed and coached.
